# SQL
Information related standard language used for querying relational databases

*SQL*, stands for *Structured Query Language*, and is the standard language used for querying relational databases. A relational database is a collection of tables consisting of columns and rows of data, that are related to each other via common key identifiers.

  * RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
  * FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)
  * Self-Join
* **Subqueries:**
  * Scalar subqueries
  * Correlated subqueries
  * Subquery in FROM clause (Derived Tables)
* **Aggregation Functions:**
  * COUNT()
  * SUM()
  * AVG()
  * MAX()
  * MIN()
* **Filtering and Sorting:**
  * WHERE clause (conditional filtering)
  * ORDER BY clause (sorting)
  * BETWEEN...AND
  * IN operator
  * LIKE operator (pattern matching)
* **Grouping and Aggregating:**
